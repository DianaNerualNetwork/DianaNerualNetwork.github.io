üë®‚Äçüéì Short Bio
I am now a freshman master student in the school of ShenZhen Institue of Advanced Techonolgy under the supervision of [Wenjian Qin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QulpzUAAAAAJ&hl=en).Prior to this,I graduated from Mechanical and Electrical Engineering  College, Wuhan University of Technology with a bachelor‚Äôs degree with the honor of oustanding graduate and Undergraduate extracurricular training for outstanding student in 2023.

My research interests mainly focus on advanced medical logic computing, aiming to develop computer-aided diagnostic solutions related to digital pathology and microscopic cell holographic three-dimensional reconstruction. In particular, I am currently working on the following specific topics:
- IHC/non-IHC Virtual Stain transfer for digital Pathology
- Digital holography and its multidimensional imaging applications
- Segmentation model with multi modalities input

I also maintain an open and receptive attitude towards a wide range of topics related to multi-modal foundation model in medical images. Should you have any ideas or topics you wish to discuss, please feel free to reach out to me via email at any time.

- We are the first to handle the task of  virtual staining  using unpaired data with  a   formulation of pretrained diffusion models. We use a single pre-trained model on unpaired multi-domain data to achieve high structural consistency in  virtual staining using diffusion model.

    üßë‚Äçüíª**Contribution**: During my internship, I was engaged in a project sponsored by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, with the project grant number No. 2020YFC2003800. My responsibility involved devising multi-object recognition algorithms designed for the visually impaired community. **I was committed to the research of robust and stable RGB-D semantic segmentation algorithms and explored the feasibility of employing StableDiffusion in smart guide glasses using only depth information.**
  
    üéâ**Achieved**: In the course of my internship, I devoted my research to developing an innovative multi-level feature rectification and noise gating model to compensate for the inconsistencies in depth map capturing devices. My work led to the successful submission and publication of a paper in an SCI-indexed journal, the filing of two Chinese invention patents, and one international patent.
- *2022.010 - 2023.07*, Baidu,PaddlePaddle, remote(Student Developer (Part-time)),China.
  
    üßë‚Äçüíª**Contribution**: As an integral part of the project team, I contributed significantly to the architectural development of our project framework. My primary responsibility entailed the reproduction of state-of-the-art (SOTA) findings within the depth completion domain, followed by their successful incorporation into our project's main branch.Our project: [PaddleDepth](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDepth) **The project was selected as an outstanding open source project by the annual community summit**
