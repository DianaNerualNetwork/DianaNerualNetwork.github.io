# 🧑‍💻 Internships
- *2022.011 - 2023.07*, [SIAT](http://english.siat.ac.cn/), on-site(Intern (Full-time, Contractual)),ShenZhen,China.
  
    🧑‍💻**Contribution**: During my internship, I was engaged in a project sponsored by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, with the project grant number No. 2020YFC2003800. My responsibility involved devising multi-object recognition algorithms designed for the visually impaired community. **I was committed to the research of robust and stable RGB-D semantic segmentation algorithms and explored the feasibility of employing StableDiffusion in smart guide glasses using only depth information.**
  
    🎉**Achieved**: In the course of my internship, I devoted my research to developing an innovative multi-level feature rectification and noise gating model to compensate for the inconsistencies in depth map capturing devices. My work led to the successful submission and publication of a paper in an SCI-indexed journal, the filing of two Chinese invention patents, and one international patent.
